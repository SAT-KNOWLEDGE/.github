Hello there, passerby! 

We are a team fueled by passion and innovation, dedicated to harnessing the latest in technology to tackle challenges in information management and knowledge sharing.

Our mission is to devise technological solutions that bridge people and knowledge, fostering learning.

## üëè Healthy Collaboration

1. Enjoy your work; if not, speak up!
2. Take care of our entire code base and infrastructure.
3. Welcome constructive and honest feedback on your designs and ideas.
4. Aim for more than technical excellence; be someone others are eager to collaborate with.
5. Understand when to compromise: there are multiple ways to approach a problem.
6. Own your mistakes instead of blaming others.
7. Prefer public asynchronous communication and keep meetings to a minimum.

## üôå Building for Sustainability

2. Use hacks only as temporary solutions, not standard practice.
3. Prevent temporary fixes from becoming permanent.

5. Address the underlying issues, not just the surface symptoms (i.e., tackle technical debt).
6. Scout Rule: Always leave things better than you found them.
7. Iterate: validate your ideas before aiming for perfection.
8. Design for the future, but implement for the present.

## üí™ Continuous Growth

1. Constantly improve both your technical skills and your teamwork.
2. Pursue excellence in all endeavors.
3. Mentor others, contributing to the team's collective improvement.
